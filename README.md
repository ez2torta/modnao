Naomi & Dreamcast ROM Model Viewer/Virtual Debugger for games using the standard Sega Naomi Library model format; Used to help with reverse engineering and creating stage importers/exporters in a user-friendly way.

Note: this is an early WIP.

## Tools
### bin/ripStage.mjs ###

Provided a given stage file, generates a custom formatted JSON in a more human-friendly interface that provides meta-data with annotations such as where in RAM a polygon or mesh actually is when loaded into VRAM for each model discovered in lookup table available.

## Credits/Acknowledgement
While there are changes in some abstractions used in the internal format, this project would not have been possible without several people who put in work to reverse engineer and uncover the [Naomi Library model format](https://github.com/NaomiMod/NL-ModelFormat):
